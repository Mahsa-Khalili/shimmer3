♦This is a general purpose configurable application to be used with shimmer3 and any add-on 
 daughter-cards supplied by Shimmer.


♦Log file Format:
          | SD Header | Data Buffer 1 | Data Buffer 2 ...
   Byte #:|   0~255   |    256~...    |     ...


♦Data Buffer Format:
   if sync=1
          | time diff | Data Block 1 | Data Block 2 ...
   Byte #:|    0~8    |     9~...    |    ...
   if sync=0
          | Data Block 1 | Data Block 2 ...
   Byte #:|     0~...    |    ...   
   - Data Buffer size <= 512
   - Data buffer always store integer number of Data Blocks

   
♦Data Block Format:
          |TimeStamp|Achan1|Achan2| ... |AchanX | Dchan1  | Dchan2  | ... |    DchanY   |
   Byte #:|   0-1   | 2~3  | 4~5  | ... |2x~2x+1|2x+2~2x+3|2x+4~2x+5| ... |2x+2y~2x+2y+1|
   - some digital channels have more than 2 bytes data
   - refer to user manual for endianness of each specific channel

 
♦UART structure:
   set/get/response Packet Format:
          |start_sign | cmd | length | comp | prop |     data     |          crc         |
   Byte #:|     0     |  1  |   2    |  3   |  4   | 5~(4+length) | (5+length)~(6+length)|
  
   where start_sign  (1 byte) = '$' (0x24)
         cmd         (1 byte) = command names (e.g. SET/GET/RSP/ACK)
         length      (1 byte) = size of comp + prop + data
         comp        (1 byte) = component names (e.g. SHIMMER/BATT/DAUGHTER CARD)
         prop        (1 byte) = property of the corresponding component (e.g. MAC/RANGE/OFFSET)
         data        (up to 128 bytes) = args to pass
         crc         (2 bytes)
   example: to get shimmer mac address, send:
   Content(0x) | 24 | 03   03   01   02  crc_l  crc_h |
     Byte #:   | 1  |  2    3    4    5    6      7   |
  
   ack/nack Packet Format: (this packet type responds to 'set' commands)
         | start_sign | cmd | crc |
   Byte #|      0     |  1  | 2~3 |
   example: bad argument nack
     Byte #:  | 1  |   2     3     4   |
   Content(0x)| 24 | 0xfd  crc_l crc_h |

♦Sync sturcture:
   A synchronisation (sync) method include one center and a few nodes (1-20). In sync mode, 
   when logging, the center tries to connect the nodes periodically. When a connection is 
   uccessfully build, the center sends its center_local_time (8 bytes) to the current connected 
   node x. The slave compares the difference between the center_local_time and its node_x_local_time
   and stores the time difference in the front of the next "to be written" data buffer.
   
   To store the time difference, when sync is enabled, the first 9 bytes are always reserved in
   the Data Buffers. If the connection is successfully built, byte 0 is assigned 0 to indicate 
   node_x_local_time > center_local_time, 1 to indicate the opposite. the time difference between 
   the two local time values is stored in bytes 1-8. If none connection was successfully built, 
   0xff will be assigned to bytes 0-8 of the Data Buffers.
   
   To configure sync mode, in sdlog.cfg file, set: 
      sync=1 to enable sync mode
      iammaster=1 to indicate this shimmer is a center
      iammaster=0 to indicate this shimmer is a node
      node=0123456789ab to set the node names
         - each node requires a new line with "node=" in the config file.
      est_exp_len=n, in unit minute, estimated experiment length. 
         - this value must be kept the same on the center and all the nodes in the experiment
         - when n>=10, n/3 will be taken as sync interval time.
            - the center tries to communicate with each of the listed nodes every interval time.
               - on successfully connected to a node, the center won't try to connect it again.
               - the center turns off its bluetooth and stop trying to connect the nodes when
                  (1) all nodes are successfully connected once 
                     - twice if its the first connection in the whole experiment
                  (2) 800s has exipred
                  (3) (interval time - 2s) has expired
                  which ever happens first.    
            - nodes turn on their bluetooth module and tries to be connected by the center every 
              interval time.
               - on not receiving the center's connection, nodes restart their bluetooth every 50s 
               - nodes turn off their bluetooth and stop the waiting when
                  (1) a connection is successfully built
                  (2) 800s has exipred
                  (3) (interval time - 2s) has expired
                  which ever happens first.               
         - when n<10, the center and all the nodes enter the short experiment mode
            - in this mode, the center tries to connect all nodes listed in sdlog.cfg file
            - one by one, according to the sequence in sdlog.cfg file
            - when reaching the last node, the center rolls back to connect the 1st node
            - nodes turn on their bluetooth and tries to get connected
            - neither the center nor the slaves stop
      singletouch=1 to enable single touch mode,
         - in this mode, all features above are supported
         - the nodes turn on their bluetooth and try to get connected by the center even when 
           not logging. 
         - either user button press or successfully connection from the center can start logging
         - the center only controls the start, user has to stop logging manually
